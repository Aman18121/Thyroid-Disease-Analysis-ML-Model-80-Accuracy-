# Thyroid-Disease-Analysis-ML-Model-80-Accuracy-
In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of the Thyroid Disease Data (available at [**https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jainaru/thyroid-disease-data/data**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jainaru/thyroid-disease-data/data){.uri}). This dataset includes 13 clinicopathologic features and aims to predict the recurrence of well-differentiated thyroid cancer. The data was collected over 15 years, with each patient monitored for at least 10 years. The analysis involved data visualization and the development of a machine learning model.Use this link to see the project on browser
